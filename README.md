# Cyber-Security-Research
I learned network security fundamentals, analyzed threats, set up a secure network, and used Wireshark for traffic analysis. Then, I explored web app security with OWASP ZAP &amp; WebGoat, identifying SQLi, XSS, and CSRF vulnerabilities while practicing basic exploitation. These tasks boosted my hands-on skills in securing systems and spotting flaws.
